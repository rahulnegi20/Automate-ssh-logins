# Automate-ssh-logins
This repo uses batch file (windows), to automate your tedious ssh logins. 

If you're work requires a lot of interactions with servers, this might be handy.

> this [blog](https://rahulnegi20.medium.com/automate-your-ssh-logins-with-this-bat-script-for-your-private-network-5064507087a2) explains this in breief.

## Requiremets:
- putty.exe (Download link [here](https://www.putty.org/)])

## How to use:

- Just download/copy-paste the script to your desktop.
- provide your server credentials in the script.
- run the script.


> Note : If you're desktop has multiple users, it is advisable to not store your password in the script instead use this. 

<code> 
  set /p password="Enter password: "
</code>

 I belive this still wins over whole manual processðŸ˜†.
 
 Thanks
